User Manual:

User can choose one of the following buttons, (Livingroom, Kitchen, Bedroom, Bathroom) based off of what kind of room the user is looking to paint.

After the user clicks a button, a pop up window appears with information from describing what types of colors work for that room and why. It also provides a couple of colors as examples in the text as well.
